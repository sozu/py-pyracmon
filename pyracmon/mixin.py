class CRUDMixin(SelectMixin):
    """
    Default mixin of every model type providing class methods available on all model types.

    Every method takes the DB connection object as its first argument.

    Following arguments are shared in some methods. Some of them have variations in their forms which are available commonly in every method.

    .. list-table::
       :widths: 10 15 50

       * - name
         - type
         - description
       * - pks
         - `Dict[str, Any]`
         - Values of multiple primary keys. Key of ``dict`` corresponds to column name.
       * - 
         - `Any`
         - A value of primary key.
       * - record
         - Model type
         - A model object representing a record. Only existing columns affects the operation.
       * - 
         - `Dict[str, Any]`
         - A ``dict`` where column name is mapped to its value. Only existing columns affects the operation.
       * - condition
         - `Conditional`
         - Query condition to select rows to fetch, update or delete.
       * - lock
         - `Any`
         - Any type of object whose string representation is appended to the end of query.
       * - qualifier
         - `Dict[str, Callable[[str], str]]`
         - Functions to convert query expressions for columns. Each function takes default expression and should return actual expression.

    Lock is designed to create locking statement but currently it is simply a string appended to the query.
    The usage will be changed in future version.

    Qualifier is used typically to convert or replace placeholder marker in insert/update query.
    By default, those queries contain markers like ``insert into t (c1, c2) values (?, ?)`` ( ``Q`` parameter style).
    We need sometimes qualify markers to apply DB function, calculation, type cast and so on. This feature enables them like below.

    >>> t.insert(db, dict(c1=1, c2=None), dict(c1=lambda x: f"{x}+1", c2=lambda x: "now()"))
    >>> # SQL: INSERT INTO t (c1, c2) VALUES (?+1, now())

    Be aware that when model object is used for the second argument, its column values may differ from actual values in DB after query.
